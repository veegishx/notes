# What are design patterns?

Design patterns are re-usable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They can be imagined as a set of generalized customizable blueprints that can be implemented in different ways to solve different problems

<Aside title="Good to know..." body={["<strong>Idioms:</strong> The most basic and low-level patterns.", "<strong>Architectural Patterns:</strong> The most universal and high-level patterns."]} />

**Difference between an algorithm vs a design patterns**

Algorithm -> a list of specific steps to achieve a particular goal

Design Pattern -> a blueprint giving a generalized/high level description of a solution

**The 3 main types of  design patterns**

* **Creational Patterns**

  \- Deal with the way objects are created.
* **Structural Patterns**

  \- Explains how simple objects and classes are assembled into larger and complex structures while keeping them flexible.
* **Behavioral Patterns**

  \- Explains communication between classes and objects
